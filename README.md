# ADSRC
Deep learning system of dissection

## âš™ Setup
#### 1. Recommended environment
- PyTorch 1.7.0
- Python 3.6
- OpenCV 3.4.2

#### 2. Data
- The test dataset used to support the findings of this study is publicly available at Mendeley Data, V1, doi: 10.17632/5b3wx7mkk6.1, 10.17632/4yfcyv5xsk.1, and 10.17632/2yxbmchmgg.1. Any data use will be restricted to noncommercial research purposes.

#### 3. Model
- The testing model used in this system can get from "Baidu Netdisk": https://pan.baidu.com/s/1TrPIBL7_VTTO9e5G5nhjsw with Enter Code: w7fi
- Please place the models at "use_opti" dir.

## ðŸ“¦ Run
- Run the file "main.py" in "use_opti" dir to get classication results and diameter measument tabel recorded in excel file.
- After run the file "main.py", run the file "GetDiameterFromExcel.py" in "diameter" dir to get the average diameter.
